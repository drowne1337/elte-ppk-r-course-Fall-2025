# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv"

cocktails <- read_tsv(url)

glimpse(cocktails)
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
clean_cocktails <- cocktails %>%
  #put them in separate rows
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>|<br>|\\n") %>%
  
  #cleaned of all quantities
  mutate(
    ingredients_clean = ingredients %>%
      str_remove_all("[0-9/\\.]+") %>% 
      str_remove_all("oz|dashes|dash|drop|drops|bsp|tsp|cl|ml") %>%
      str_remove_all("\\(.*\\)") %>%
      str_remove_all("%|abv") %>%
      str_trim()
  ) %>%
  filter(ingredients_clean != "")
  
head(clean_cocktails$ingredients_clean)
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
ingredient_list <- clean_cocktails %>%
  distinct(ingredients_clean) %>%
  arrange(ingredients_clean)

ingredient_list
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
nrow(ingredient_list)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
clean_cocktails %>%
  count(ingredients_clean, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
ingredient_counts <- clean_cocktails %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(n_ingredients = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_ingredients))

ingredient_counts %>%
  filter(n_ingredients == max(n_ingredients))
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
one_ingredient <- clean_cocktails %>%
  count(ingredients_clean) %>%
  filter(n == 1)

nrow(one_ingredient)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
cocktails_rare <- clean_cocktails %>%
  semi_join(one_ingredient, by = "ingredients_clean") %>%
  distinct(name)

cocktails_rare
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
all_cocktails <- clean_cocktails %>% distinct(name)

common_cocktails <- all_cocktails %>%
  anti_join(cocktails_rare, by = "name")

common_cocktails
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
bartender_matrix <- clean_cocktails %>%
  distinct(name, ingredients_clean) %>% 
  mutate(present = "X") %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = ingredients_clean, 
    values_from = present, 
    values_fill = ""
  ) %>%
  select(name, sort(names(.)))

view(bartender_matrix)
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
